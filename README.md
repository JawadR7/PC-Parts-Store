# PC-Parts-Store
This repository contains our group project for our Database Management course.
Our project is an online store that connects PC part sellers and buyers.
Buyers can search for and place orders for different PC components.
Sellers can list various items they want to sell on the website.
This project mainly makes use of SQL for the database as it's what we're learning in the course.
